    <h2> Experience</h2>

    <p>
      Throughout my academic journey at UMass Boston, I have built a strong foundation in Information Technology
      through intensive coursework and hands-on projects. My studies have covered a wide range of subjects—from 
      programming languages like Python, C, and SQL to specialized courses in Linux/Unix, networking, and web fluency.
    </p>

    <p>
      This academic background allowed me to gain valuable experience in system administration:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Managed Unix-based systems, including DNS servers, mail systems, and automation using shell scripts.</li>
      <li>Developed projects such as a day-of-week updater, A* algorithm for puzzle solving, and implementations of core
        data structures.</li>
      <li>Strengthened technical skills and problem-solving abilities through hands-on IT challenges.</li>
    </ul>
     <p>here is a table full  of my academic courses during my it journey at UMB: </p>

      Complementing my academic and project-based experience, my role as an IT Intern at Canaccord Genuity LLC provided
      practical, real-world exposure to IT operations. I was responsible for configuring and maintaining IT inventories,
      which included managing computers, peripherals, and software licenses to ensure seamless operations across the
      organization. My key responsibilities included:   <img src="cg.png" class=" Canaccord" alt="Canaccord Genuity LLC" width="200" height="200">
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Providing support for video conferencing setups and troubleshooting IT issues for employees.</li>
      <li>Maintaining IT inventory and conducting security risk assessments.</li>
      <li>Documenting IT processes using tools such as Active Directory, Azure, Intune, and Autopilot.</li>
    </ul>
                                                                                                      
    <p>
      Looking ahead, I am eager to leverage both my academic and professional experiences to secure a full-time
      position in IT—particularly in system administration or cybersecurity. I am confident that my technical skills,
      problem-solving mindset, and passion for technology will allow me to thrive in a dynamic and challenging
      environment. I look forward to contributing to a team that values innovation, collaboration, and excellence.
